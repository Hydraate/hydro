# Utilities

This directory is composed of utility scripts for assisted automation of managing or compiling source.
The `boilerplate.py` script prepends a header to C/C++ and Hydro files in the `hydro/`, `src/`, and `include/` directories.
This action is done recursively.
The `natgen.py` script generates the `include/hydro/hydro_native.cpp` file from sources listed in the `hydro/` directory.
